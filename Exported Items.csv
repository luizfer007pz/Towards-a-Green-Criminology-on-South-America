An integrated conservation program has focused on reversing the causes of parrot population decline on the Macanao Peninsula in Margarita Island. As a result, the parrot population on the island has increased to about 1900 individuals in 1996 from an estimated population of 750 in 1989, when the project started. Cooperation from national and local authorities and the project’s community outreach have resulted in several confiscated chicks. Whereas most confiscated chicks were successfully reintroduced in a cross‐fostering nest program, some had to be kept in captivity for later release. We hand‐reared 14 A. barbadensis and housed them for a year in a large outdoor aviary. Before release the birds were screened to determine their general health. Four parrots were fitted with radio transmitters and monitored for a minimum of 11 months. All 4 birds with radio transmitters survived and adapted successfully to their natural environment, 10 of the 12 released parrots survived at least 1 year, and 1 was seen alive 34 months after release. Integration into wild groups varied from 5 days to 9 months, with the two youngest parrots showing a slower integration process. None of the parrots reproduced the first year after release. Later three were seen scouting nesting holes with their partners, and one of the parrots was confirmed attending a nest with three eggs 28 months after release. Two chicks fledged from this nest. A substantial portion of the success of this program rests on 5 years of previous work on environmental education, public awareness, and studies on the parrot’s biology. To provide some guidance on the costs of reintroduction projects, we estimated an overall expenditure of about U.S. $2800 per parrot. Previous attempts to reintroduce captive‐raised parrots have had limited success, and our study indicates that reintroduction is feasible when captive‐raised parrots are introduced to an area with a resident population. Although reintroduction can significantly reduce the chances of extinction, it also involves some risks. The long‐term solution against extinction of A. barbadensis will be a combination of scientific understanding of their biology and habitat, awareness by local human communities, reduction in the wild bird trade, and continued commitment by conservation enforcement agencies.             Reintroducción Exitosa del Loro Espalda Amarilla del Amazonas Criados en Cautiverio en la Isla Margarita, Venezuela             La cotorra cabeziamarilla (Amazona barbadensis) es uno de los loros más amenazados de Venezuela. Un programa integrado de conservación se enfocó a revertir las causas de la declinación poblacional de cotorras en la Península de Macanao, en la Isla de Margarita. Como resultado, la población total de cotorras en la isla se incrementó hasta los 1900 individuos en 1996, a partir de una población estimada de 750 individuos cuando comenzó el proyecto en 1989. La cooperación de las autoridades nacionales y locales y las actividades educativas, han conducido a varios decomisos de polluelos. Aun cuando la mayoría de los polluelos fueron reintroducidos en un exitoso programa de nidos nodriza, algunos se tuvieron que mantener en cautiverio para soltarlos después. Para este estudio, un total de 14 A. barbadensis fueron criadas a mano y albergadas en un gran aviario durante un año. Antes de soltarlas, las aves fueron sometidas a análisis de salud general. Se le pusieron radio transmisores a cuatro cotorras, y se monitorearon por 11 meses. Todas las cuatro cotorras con radio transmisores sobrevivieron y se adaptaron exitosamente a su ambiente natural, 10 de las 12 cotorras sobrevivieron al menos durante un año, y una cotorra estaba viva al menos 34 meses después de soltarlas. La integración a grupos silvestres varió entre 5 días y 9 meses, y las dos cotorras mas jóvenes mostraron un proceso de integración más lento. Ninguna de las cotorras se reprodujo el primer año después de soltarlas. Tres de las cotorras fueron vistas explorando oquedades con sus parejas durante el segundo año, y una cuarta fue vista atendiendo un nido con tres huevos, a los 28 meses después de soltarla. Dos polluelos volaron de este nido. Una parte significativa del éxito de este estudio se basa en 5 años de trabajo previo en educación ambiental, conocimiento del publico, y estudios de biología de las cotorras. Para guiar los costos de proyectos de reintroducción, estimamos que el costo total estuvo alrededor de U.S.$2800 por cotorra. Pruebas anteriores para reintroducir loros criados en cautiverio han tenido éxito limitado. Los resultados de nuestro estudio indican que la reintroducción es posible cuando los loros criados en cautiverio son introducidos en un área donde existe una población silvestre residente. Aún cuando la reintroducción puede contribuir a reducir las oportunidades de extinción de esta y otras especies de cotorras, también acarrea riesgos. La solución a largo plazo contra la extinción será una combinación de entendimiento científico de la biología y habitat, conocimiento por parte de las comunidades humanas locales, reducción de la demanda de aves silvestres para el tráfico de mascotas, y la dedicación y continuidad de agencias conservacionistas y de guardería.","1998-04-26","2025-05-04 22:23:07","2025-05-04 22:23:07","2025-05-04 22:23:07","430-441","","2","12","","Conservation Biology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using a focus group and thematic analysis, the study shows that Brazil is perceived as having a ‘diverse and positive culture’. Considering the English participants’ awareness of the country, the most prevalent themes were ‘football’, ‘Carnival,’ ‘Rio’ and ‘music.’ Furthermore, the most indicative of Brazil’s unique cultural associations were ‘flip-flops,’ ‘Amazon,’ ‘carnival parades,’ ‘Brazil nuts’, and ‘Brazilian native indigenous’. While the most positive associations were ‘carnival,’ ‘music,’ ‘indigenous tribes’ and ‘films’; the most negative associations were ‘social inequality,’ ‘poverty,’ ‘corruption,’ ‘political problems’ and ‘crime.’ Nevertheless, Brazil’s brand image is somewhat recognized more favourable than unfavourable by these English participants.

Ethnographic research methods form a useful way to get insight into the dynamics and complexity of tropical deforestation, which often is illegal. This article gives an account of various ethnographic visits to the rainforests of the Amazon in the period 2003-2014. Ethnographic methods provide insight into the overlap between the legal and illegal, the functioning (or not) of state institutions, the power of (corporate) lobbies, and why tropical deforestation correlates with crimes such as corruption and violence. The use of ethnographic methods in forest areas where trustworthy state actors and institutions are not very present can also present danger and raise ethical issues (such as when the researcher, for reasons of safety, does not present as a criminological researcher). However, a large advantage of ethnographic visits to tropical rainforests is that they allow the gathering of local views and voices, which rarely reach the international level. These local views lead to interesting contradictions at the international level where corporate views and lobbies dominate.","2014-08-01","2025-05-04 22:23:23","2025-05-04 22:23:23","2025-05-04 22:23:23","35-48","","2","3","","Int J for Crime, Justice & Social Democracy","","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/home/rudi/Zotero/storage/JTV3IBCT/Boekhout Van Solinge - 2014 - Researching Illegal Logging and Deforestation.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The novel also reveals the subhuman condition in which the women in the rubber plantation live, subject to rape and other sort of violence. Women are more deeply colonized and exploited than the rubber men. We argue that violence against women and workers today reflects violence in rubber plantations in the XX century.

Using a mixed-methods approach, the IBAMA and TJTO databases were analyzed through descriptive and inferential statistics, employing tools such as R Studio and Jupyter (Python) for data processing and mapping. The results revealed a negative correlation of -0.31 between the number of violations recorded by the IBAMA and the number of judicial processes in the TJTO. Qualitative analysis served to complement and evaluate the statistical results. Areas with a high incidence of environmental crimes were identified, mainly concentrated in the agricultural frontier regions and logging areas in Tocantins. This research highlights the importance of inter-institutional collaboration between IBAMA and TJTO to enhance the effectiveness of enforcement and legal proceedings. The limited capacity of the TJTO to process all cases of environmental crimes was identified as a factor influencing the observed negative correlation, indicating the need for more robust strategies to integrate administrative sanctions with judicial processes. The study concludes that to improve environmental governance in the Legal Amazon, it is essential to invest in advanced monitoring technologies and provide continuous training to professionals involved in the enforcement and prosecution of environmental crimes. The implementation of more effective and integrated public policies is also crucial for addressing the challenges posed by environmental protection in the region. This research reinforces the need for a multidimensional and collaborative approach to preserve natural resources and promote sustainability in the Legal Amazon.","2024-07-30","2025-05-04 22:24:17","2025-05-04 22:24:17","2025-05-04 22:24:17","","","5","11","","DRIUFT","","","","","","","","","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/home/rudi/Zotero/storage/T2GLA6J6/Ludwig et al. - 2024 - ANALYSING THE NOTICES OF VIOLATION ISSUED BY IBAMA, AND THE ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE TJTO IN RELATION TO.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present study aimed to evaluate the toxicity of two commercial formulations of pesticides on soil fauna using the springtail Folsomia candida. A natural soil classified as Inceptisol, characteristic of the western region of the Santa Catarina State, was used. The treatments in both tests consisted of six concentrations of the fungicide Comet® (a.i. pyraclostrobin) (0.35; 0.70; 1.40; 2.10; 2.80 and 4.00 mg kg-1 of soil) and of the fungicide + insecticide Standak®Top (a.i. pyraclostrobin + thiophanate-methyl + fipronil) (0.20; 0.60; 1.20; 1.80; 2.40 and 3.00 mg kg-1 soil), plus the control treatment. Acute and chronic tests were carried out following ISO guidelines. Both products proved to be toxic to the evaluated species. Lethality effects were observed in relation to the control of the organisms exposed to low concentrations of the fungicide (0.35 mg kg-1 soil); while for the fungicide + insecticide formulation, lethality was observed at higher concentrations, from 2.40 mg kg-1 soil (LC50 > 3.00 mg kg-1 soil). The reproductive rate was affected only in organisms exposed to the fungicide, with a reduction in the number of juveniles at concentration from 4.00 mg kg-1 soil, with EC20 of 3.38 mg kg-1 soil (2.79–3.96).

We determined availability and characteristics of tree-cavities in 24 1-ha survey plots in Los Chimalapas, southeast Mexico, with 9 plots in evergreen forest, 7 in riparian, and 8 in secondary forest. We compared these with 40 parrot nest-trees to determine whether parrots select cavities with specific characteristics for nesting. Over half of Northern Mealy Amazon nests occurred in live trees of Terminalia amazonia (32.5%) and Dialium guianense (20%). Compared with available cavities, the Northern Mealy Amazon selected nest-cavities in significantly larger trees, at a greater height above the ground, with larger internal diameter, and greater depth. In particular, internal diameter and cavity depth predicted whether a cavity was selected as a nest-site by parrots. We found a low density of 2.3 available cavities/ha in the study site, although only 1.6 cavities/ha had characteristics suitable for use as nest-sites by parrots. Cavities in secondary forest occurred in smaller trees, at a lower height, and with shallower depth, where only 0.75 cavities/ha were suitable for nesting by parrots. Our results demonstrate that the Northern Mealy Amazon requires nest-cavities in large, old trees able to form large cavities, the majority of which occur in primary forest. The low density of suitable nest-sites for parrots in secondary forest suggests that increased degradation of primary tropical moist forest may have long-term implications for reproduction of this threatened species.","2016-10","2025-05-04 22:24:29","2025-05-04 22:24:29","2025-05-04 22:24:29","1940082916680361","","4","9","","Tropical Conservation Science","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/home/rudi/Zotero/storage/BLHWKPKP/De Labra-Hernández and Renton - 2016 - Importance of Large, Old Primary Forest Trees in Nest-Site Selection by the Northern Mealy Amazon (.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article examines how the ICC can prosecute environmental destruction as a crime against humanity under Article 7 of the Rome Statute. It presents a survey of the potential jurisdictional and substantive issues of prosecuting environmental issues and uses the victims’ request asking the Prosecutor to investigate environmental destruction by Chevron in the Ecuadorian Amazon as a backdrop. The article proceeds in three parts. Firstly, it discusses the request by the victims in Ecuador asking for the Prosecutor to investigate. Secondly, it sets out the basic jurisdictional framework of the ICC and analyzes why the Prosecutor rejected the victims’ request. Thirdly, it examines Article 7 and concludes that while peacetime environmental destruction committed by a non-state actor that results in a humanitarian atrocity can qualify as a crime against humanity, the factual circumstances alleged in the Ecuadorian victims’ request did not amount to a crime against humanity under the Rome Statute.","2017-09","2025-05-04 22:24:31","2025-05-04 22:24:31","2025-05-04 22:24:31","707-729","","3","30","","Leiden Journal of International Law","Environmental Destruction in Ecuador","","","","","","","en","https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To answer that question, this article examines the primary tool of enforcement, environmental prosecution, one of the region's newest and most‐innovative developments in policy and institutional reform. It creates an analytical framework that explains how the two pillars of prosecution, the state and the law, are also its two main weaknesses. Within the state, it examines deficiencies in investigation and resources. Within the law, it focuses on the lack of clarity in laws and in policy regulations that support them. Together, these common and inherent policy challenges make it difficult for governments throughout Latin America to halt crimes such as illegal deforestation, mining, and road building. The article develops a way to understand comparatively how ably policies are supported in practice. Empirically, it draws on five years of fieldwork in the region's two main tropical areas, Central America and the Amazon Basin. In addition to its concrete policy assessments and recommendations, the article brings a new dimension to the study of the state in Latin America and to the field of criminology.           ,              ¿Por qué América Latina sufre incluso para implementar las políticas ambientales más sólidas y generalmente aceptadas?

Crea un marco analítico que explica cómo los dos pilares del enjuiciamiento, el Estado y la ley, también son sus principales debilidades. Respecto al Estado, examina las deficiencias en las investigaciones y los recursos. Respecto a la ley, se enfoca en la falta de claridad en las leyes y en las normas que las apoyan. En conjunto, estos retos comunes e intrínsecos complican el proceso de frenar los crímenes como la tala ilegal, la minería ilegal y la construcción no permitida de caminos en América Latina.

However, in the last decade there has been a steep increase in these activities, and in socio-environmental conflicts, in Latin America. There are indications of the links between the exploitation of natural resources and the violation of human rights, which materializes in the Amazon through the increase of expulsions and evictions of families, assassination attempts, murders, illegal imprisonments, intimidation, and threats. The main targets of these crimes are leaders who head the struggle to defend the rights of collectivities to land and territory, the environment, human rights and their multiple cultural and life expressions. The state of Pará (Eastern Amazonia) has appeared in the last decade as one of the states in Brazil with the highest incidence of cases of land conflicts, assassinations, aggression, defamation, and death threats directed against community leaders and environmental defenders. Thus, this article aims to quantify, characterize and reflect on the environmental defenders and community leaders suffering death threats and under legal protection in the state of Pará, Eastern Amazonia (between 2014 and 2020).

To test whether environmental and social manipulations might stimulate reproduction in captive, wild‐caught orange‐winged Amazon parrots (               Amazona amazonica               ), we compared reproductive performance in pairs presented with nest boxes (controls) or nest boxes plus additional environmental and social manipulations (enriched group) consisting of misting, fruit supplementation, nest hole restriction, enlarged nest boxes, and pair separation/reunification. In the first breeding trial, in 1990, enriched pairs were more likely to lay eggs (six of seven enriched pairs vs. one of eight control pairs;               P               < 0.09). When treatments were reversed the following years (e.g., 1990 controls were exposed to enriched conditions in 1991), reproductive performance was not different between the groups (four of seven enriched pairs laid eggs vs. five of seven control pairs), although three pairs in the 1991 enriched group laid eggs which had not laid eggs before. These results are consistent with the idea that while enriched environments may enhance the probability of a first episode of egg laying in captivity, once pairs have laid eggs in captivity, little stimulation beyond that provided by nest box presentation is required to reinitiate egg laying. The environmental and social manipulations of the enriched conditions could be useful in increasing reproductive performance of captive Amazon parrots for the companion bird trade. © 1995 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.","1995-01","2025-05-04 22:24:45","2025-05-04 22:24:45","2025-05-04 22:24:45","275-284","","3","14","","Zoo Biology","","","","","","","","en","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article seeks to analyze how the command and control system is being practiced on one of such tropical rainforests, namely the Brazilian Amazon. To achieve the objectives set in the research, exploratory/descriptive methods of qualitative and quantitative approach were carried out through field research and literature review on the subject. In addition, we evaluated the publications that best described the “state of the art” of the theme, always aiming at the quality and comprehensiveness of research by bibliometric mining and field survey through questionnaires administered to military police corporations. While examining the environmental protection agencies and law enforcement agencies, both from Union and the states that make up the Legal Amazon, the conclusion was that all of them devote very little material resources to effective forest protection, and that human resources are infinitely smaller than those recommended by other international nature protection organizations. Moreover, the structure in charge of investigating environmental crimes in the states is either poor or non-existent, and distant from the main regions of deforestation and other environmental crimes, something which favors impunity. It is concluded that the lack of structure of command and control bodies in the Amazon threatens the sustainability of the ecosystem, the economy and the society on local, regional, and global levels.","2021-02-04","2025-05-04 22:24:47","2025-05-04 22:24:47","2025-05-04 22:24:47","49-64","","1","56","","Rev.

These challenges, exacerbated by the lack of land regularization, require policies that promote socio-environmental justice and territorial rights of traditional populations (Sauer & Marés, 2013; Clement & Fonseca, 2008).   Methods: The research adopts a methodological approach based on literature review and analysis of data from institutions such as IBGE, INCRA, and Comissão Pastoral da Terra. The triangulation of quantitative and qualitative data allowed for an in-depth understanding of occupation patterns and territorial conflicts in Rondônia.   Results and Discussion: The results demonstrate a correlation between conflicts, crime, and territorial management. The lack of effective public policies results in violent disputes, highlighting the need for integrated strategies to resolve these conflicts.   Research Implications: The research shows that public policies should focus on land regularization and peaceful mediation of conflicts to reduce violence and improve security in rural areas of the Amazon.   Originality/value: The study contributes by analyzing the relationship between land management and agrarian conflicts in Rondônia, proposing integrated and inclusive approaches to reduce violence and promote sustainable development.","2024-10-11","2025-05-04 22:24:57","2025-05-04 22:24:57","2025-05-04 22:24:57","e09254","","10","18","","RGSA","Territorial Conflicts and Land Management in the Amazon","","","","","","","","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/home/rudi/Zotero/storage/TCHN6WT8/Bispo et al. - 2024 - Territorial Conflicts and Land Management in the Amazon Challenges and Dynamics in Rondônia.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The environment of the mines contributes to the proliferation of vector mosquitoes and the precarious housing conditions facilitate transmission of the disease. Understanding gold miners’ perceptions is essential for the formulation of strategies to fight malaria. A qualitative study was carried out in the municipality of Calçoene, state of Amapá, Brazilian Amazon adjointining the municipality of Oiapoque, that is in the border area with French Guiana and Suriname.                                         Methods               A semi-structured interview was applied to an intentional sample of 29 miners, a number determined by the theoretical saturation criterion. Thematic analysis was adopted to obtain the results and the Cohen's Kappa index was calculated to verify the agreement between observers during coding.                                         Results               The agreement between observers was verified by a Cohen's Kappa index of 0.82. Analysis of the interviews showed that gold miners were subjected to prejudice from the community due to forest diseases that they can transmit, and their activities are often associated with crime. When the miners return to their hometown after a period of mining, the urban population blames them for the onset of diseases such as malaria. Most participants in the survey did not know how malaria transmission occurs, and associated its occurrence with contaminated water and food. Participants reported not being afraid of the disease, trusting the diagnosis and available treatment, though this depends on where they are treated. The use of therapeutic resources, such as medicinal plants and medicines acquired in the illegal market, is very common in this population. Despite the challenges identified by the research subjects, they believe that the disease can be controlled, or the cases reduced, but there was low acceptability for a possible mass drug administration (MDA) intervention.                                         Conclusion               Despite a recent reduction in malaria prevalence in Brazil, there are still vulnerable populations, such as gold miners, who help to perpetuate the existence of the disease in the Amazon. The lack of knowledge regarding how the transmission of malaria occurs, associated with myths regarding this and the use of traditional health practices and illegal drugs for the treatment of the disease without a specific diagnosis, jeopardizes the country’s efforts to eliminate malaria. It is necessary to implement control programmes in these populations, especially those who frequently travel around the border region and to remote locations, which are difficult regions for health teams to access, thus hindering diagnostic and treatment actions. For this reason, understanding the perceptions of these individuals as well as their customs, beliefs and lifestyle, can assist in the production of targeted educational material and adoption of strategies in the elimination of malaria in the country.","2021-12","2025-05-04 22:25:01","2025-05-04 22:25:01","2025-05-04 22:25:01","286","","1","20","","Malar J","Perceptions about malaria among Brazilian gold miners in an Amazonian border area","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/home/rudi/Zotero/storage/LH46QQDW/Murta et al. - 2021 - Perceptions about malaria among Brazilian gold miners in an Amazonian border area perspectives for.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study uses a qualitative research design to evaluate law enforcement efforts in Brazil, Ghana, and Indonesia. Primary data were collected through semi-structured interviews involving law enforcement personnel, government officials, environmental experts, and local community members affected by mining activities. These interviews aimed to uncover challenges in enforcing environmental laws, the effectiveness of ongoing measures, and local perceptions of enforcement outcomes. Secondary data comprised an extensive academic literature review, official reports, and legal documents to contextualize the findings within global trends. Case studies were selected based on criteria such as the prevalence of illegal gold mining, environmental impacts, and variations in enforcement strategies. Thematic analysis was employed to identify recurring issues such as corruption, resource constraints, and lack of political will. Results indicate that enforcement has had limited success in curbing deforestation, mercury contamination, and biodiversity loss, mainly due to institutional weaknesses. Enforcement measures disproportionately target small-scale miners while larger organized networks evade prosecution. This paper emphasizes the importance of addressing socioeconomic drivers through alternative livelihoods, international collaboration, and enhanced institutional capacity to achieve sustainable development goals.","2025","2025-05-04 22:25:09","2025-05-04 22:25:09","2025-05-04 22:25:09","07002","","","609","","E3S Web Conf.","","","","","","","","","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","Jan, C.; Anwer, I.; Li, L.; Ferse, S.; Nishi, M.; Puangprakhon, P.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Wildlife responses to urbanization, however, are greatly variable and, paradoxically, some threatened species may achieve much larger populations in urban than in natural habitats. Urban conservation hotspots may therefore help some species avoid regional or even global extinctions, but not conserve their often overlooked ecological functions in the wild. We aim to draw attention to this issue using two species of globally threatened parrots occurring in the Dominican Republic: the Hispaniolan amazon (                 Amazona ventralis                 ) and the Hispaniolan parakeet (                 Psittacara chloropterus                 ).                                                        Methods               We conducted a large-scale roadside survey in June 2017 across the country to estimate the relative abundance of parrots in natural habitats, rural habitats, and cities. We combined this with informal interviews with local people to collect information on past and current human impacts on parrot populations. We also looked for foraging parrots to assess their potential role as seed dispersers, an ecological function that has been overlooked until very recently.                                         Results                                Relative abundances of both parrot species were negligible in rural areas and very low in natural habitats. They were generally between one and two orders of magnitude lower than that of congeneric species inhabiting other Neotropical ecosystems. Relative abundances were six times higher in cities than in natural habitats in the case of the Hispaniolan parakeet and three times higher in the case of the Hispaniolan amazon. People indicated hunting for a source food and to mitigate crop damage as causes of parrot population declines, and a vigorous illegal trade for parrots (131 individuals recorded, 75% of them poached very recently), mostly obtained from protected areas where the last small wild populations remain. We observed parrots foraging on 19 plant species from 11 families, dispersing the fruits of 14 species by carrying them in their beaks and consuming them in distant perching trees. They discarded undamaged mature seeds, with the potential to germinate, in 99.5% of cases (                 n                 = 306), and minimum dispersal distances ranged from 8 to 155 m (median = 37 m).                                                        Discussion               The loss of ecological functions provided by some species when they disappear from natural habitats and only persist in cities may have long-term, unexpected effects on ecosystems. Our example demonstrates how two cities may soon be the last refuges for two endemic parrots if overharvesting continues, in which case their overlooked role as seed dispersers would be completely lost in nature. The functional extinction of these species could strongly affect vegetation communities in an island environment where seed-dispersal species are naturally scarce. While conservation plans must include urban populations of threatened species, greater efforts are needed to restore their populations in natural habitats to conserve ecological functions.","2018-06-22","2025-05-04 22:25:12","2025-05-04 22:25:12","2025-05-04 22:25:12","e4908","","","6","","","","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/home/rudi/Zotero/storage/AUQ3QPU2/Luna et al. - 2018 - Cities may save some threatened species but not their ecological functions.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To achieve this, all key affected and vulnerable populations by malaria, including people working on gold mining sites, must be considered. What is the situation of malaria in these particular settings and what are the challenges? This literature review aims to compile knowledge to answer these questions.                                         Recent Findings                                The contexts in which gold miners operate are very heterogeneous: size and localization of mines, links with crime, administrative status of the mines and of the miners, mobility of the workers or national regulations. The number of malaria cases has been correlated with deforestation (Brazil, Colombia), gold production (Colombia), gold prices (Guyana), or location of the mining region (Peru, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana). The burden of malaria in gold mines differs between territories: significant in Guyana, French Guiana, or Venezuela; lower in Brazil. Although                 P                                    lasmodium                                  vivax                 causes 75% of malaria cases in the Americas,                 P. falciparum                 is predominant in several gold mining regions, especially in the Guiana Shield. Because of the remoteness from health facilities, self-medication with under-the-counter antimalarials is frequent. This constitutes a significant risk for the emergence of new                 P. falciparum                 parasites resistant to antimalarial drugs.                                                        Summary               Because of the workers’ mobility, addressing malaria transmission in gold mines is essential, not only for miners, but also to prevent the (re-)emergence of malaria. Strategies among these populations should be tailored to the context because of the heterogeneity of situations in different territories. The transnational environment favoring malaria transmission also requires transborder and regional cooperation, where innovative solutions should be considered and evaluated.","2020-06","2025-05-04 22:25:24","2025-05-04 22:25:24","2025-05-04 22:25:24","37-47","","2","7","","Curr Trop Med Rep","Malaria in Gold Miners in the Guianas and the Amazon","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/home/rudi/Zotero/storage/LPCWRKDI/Douine et al. - 2020 - Malaria in Gold Miners in the Guianas and the Amazon Current Knowledge and Challenges.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since regional and country-level femicide rates can obscure significant variations at the sub-national level, it is important to provide information at the lowest relevant level of disaggregation to be able to develop targeted preventive policies. The aim of this study was to assess the spatial distribution of the femicide rate and to examine its spatial clustering at the canton level in Ecuador in the period 2018–2019.                                         Methods               Data on cases were collected by a national network of non-governmental organizations. Two age-disaggregated analyses were done, one for the 15 to 24 years-olds and the other for the female population of 15 and older. Age-specific population data were obtained from the National Institute of Statistics for the study period. Standardized mortality ratios for mapping the mortality were calculated using hierarchical Bayesian models and spatial scan statistics were applied to identify local clusters. Thematic maps of age-specific femicide rates were also constructed.                                         Results               During the two-year period, 61 and 183 women were killed in the age ranges 15–24 and 15 years and older, respectively. The annual rate of femicides in Ecuador was 1.0 and 0.8 per 100,000 in the female population aged 15–24 and 15+, respectively, with substantial variations among cantons. The spatial analysis contributed to visualize high risk cantons, which were mainly located in a small area in the central part of the country (for those 15+) but especially in the Amazon region, for both of the studied age groups.                                         Conclusions               This study has shown the usefulness of applying spatial analysis to the problem of femicides in Ecuador. The study has revealed important variations among cantons but also a spatial clustering, mainly in the Amazon region of the country. The results should help policymakers to focus on current prevention programmes for violence against women into these high-risk areas. Continuous monitoring of femicides at low-level geographical areas is highly recommended.","2021-12","2025-05-04 22:25:36","2025-05-04 22:25:36","2025-05-04 22:25:36","115","","1","20","","Int J Equity Health","“The devil is in the detail”","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/home/rudi/Zotero/storage/GD3SJCY3/Fonseca-Rodríguez and San Sebastián - 2021 - “The devil is in the detail” geographical inequalities of femicides in Ecuador.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The “war on deforestation,” announced in 2021 by Iván Duque, the former president of Colombia, is a paradigmatic example. Through Operation Artemis ( Operación Artemisa), the Colombian armed forces were assigned to protect the forests against threats from armed non-state actors (ANSAs) predominantly located in the country’s Amazon rainforests. We argue that this war was a rhetorical and political model of the Duque government that sought, based on the re-elaboration of the counterinsurgent categories shared with the United States for half a century, to implement in the Amazon the first state military strategy to reach global agreements against climate change. Why does a state wage war in the name of protecting forests? We argue that in this novel rhetorical, military, and criminal framework, the war on deforestation encouraged the renewal of the war on drugs and the transformation of the internal enemy.

Relatedly, how do people keep on cultivating a garden, caring for forest, or growing food when at any moment a crop-duster plane may pass overhead, indiscriminately spraying herbicides over entire landscapes? Since 2000, the U.S.–Colombian War on Drugs has relied on the militarized aerial fumigation of coca plants, coupled with alternative development interventions that aim to forcibly eradicate illicit livelihoods. Through ethnographic engagement with small farmers in the frontier department of Putumayo, the gateway to the country’s Amazon and a region that has been the focus of counternarcotic operations, this article explores the different possibilities and foreclosures for life and death that emerge in a tropical forest ecology under military duress. By following farmers, their material practices, and their life philosophies, I trace the ways in which human-soil relations come to potentiate forms of resistance to the violence and criminalization produced by militarized, growth-oriented development. Rather than productivity—one of the central elements of modern capitalist growth—the regenerative capacity of these ecologies relies on organic decay, impermanence, decomposition, and even fragility that complicates modernist bifurcations of living and dying, allowing, I argue, for ecological imaginaries and life processes that do not rely on productivity or growth to strive into existence.","2015-10-23","2025-05-04 22:26:02","2025-05-04 22:26:02","2025-05-04 22:26:02","56-81","","1","31","","Cult.

Ninety interviews were conducted with riverine people in the vicinity of Anavilhanas National Park, Tapajós–Arapiuns Extractive Reserve and Tapajós National Forest in the Brazilian Amazon, with the aim to increase knowledge of the feeding habits of the Amazonian manatee               Trichechus inunguis               and evaluate its conservation status in contrasting protected areas. In Anavilhanas respondents identified 31 plant species consumed by the manatee, of which vines had the highest cognitive salience index value (the summed importance of each plant species), even though they are available to manatees only during the high-water season. In the Tapajós region 37 plant species were identified, with submerged species with floating leaves being the main component of the manatee's diet. Although hunting has declined it still occurs in Anavilhanas, which is susceptible to environmental crimes because of its proximity to urban centres. Manatee hunting seems to be infrequent in the Tapajós region, having little impact on the population. Given the broad knowledge within the local community about the Amazonian manatee, involvement of riverine people in manatee conservation activities is fundamental for reducing threats and increasing conservation effectiveness.","2020-07","2025-05-04 22:26:11","2025-05-04 22:26:11","2025-05-04 22:26:11","529-538","","4","54","","Oryx","","","","","","","","en","https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/home/rudi/Zotero/storage/7EMTY7RP/Crema et al. - 2020 - Riverine people's knowledge of the Vulnerable Amazonian manatee Trichechus inunguis in contra.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Given the limited stateness in many regions, however, this article seeks to explain how only some sub-national territories have become vulnerable to illegal drug trafficking. To make this case, the representative example of the Alto Huallaga valley, in the Peruvian Amazon, is analysed. This article argues that ineffective development and settlement efforts by the Peruvian state in the Alto Huallaga, rather than the absence of the state, produced socio-ecological conditions in the region, in the late 1970s, that made it more vulnerable to the illegal economy. At the same time as international demand for illegal cocaine was expanding, two conditions resulting from frustrated state development plans came together: an enclave of poor peasants who were not self-sufficient and a natural environment impoverished by soil degradation and intensive deforestation, paradoxically not suitable for any crop except coca.           ,              Spanish abstract             El origen de las economías ilícitas ha sido entendido como una consecuencia de la baja estatalidad. Sin embargo, dada la baja estatalidad en muchos territorios, este artículo busca explicar cómo solo algunos territorios subnacionales se han vuelto vulnerables al tráfico ilícito de drogas. Para ello, se analiza la formación del emblemático caso del Alto Huallaga en la Amazonía del Perú. El artículo sostiene que los infructuosos esfuerzos desarrollistas y de colonización del Estado peruano en el Alto Huallaga, y no su ausencia, produjeron condiciones socio-ecológicas en el territorio a fines de los 70 que lo hizo vulnerable a la ilegalidad. Al mismo tiempo que se expandía la demanda internacional por cocaína ilegal, se ensamblaban de forma efectiva y temporal en el territorio dos condiciones producidas por el desarrollismo estatal frustrado: un enclave de campesinos pobres sin autonomía productiva y una ecología devastada por la degradación de suelos e intensiva deforestación, paradójicamente apta para casi ningún cultivo, excepto la coca.           ,              Portuguese abstract             A origem das economias ilícitas tem sido entendida como uma consequência da fraca presença do Estado.

O artigo argumenta que foram os esforços mal sucedidos de desenvolvimento e colonização do estado peruano no território do Alto Huallaga no final dos anos 70, e não sua ausência, que produziram as condições socioecológicas que o tornaram vulnerável à ilegalidade. Ao mesmo tempo em que a demanda internacional por cocaína ilegal se expandiu, duas condições produzidas pelo desenvolvimentismo estatal frustrado foram efetiva e temporariamente reunidas neste território: um enclave de camponeses pobres sem autonomia produtiva e uma ecologia devastada pela degradação do solo e pelo desmatamento intensivo, paradoxalmente inadequado para quase toda cultura, exceto a coca.","2021-05","2025-05-04 22:26:16","2025-05-04 22:26:16","2025-05-04 22:26:16","245-267","","2","53","","J.

The prevalence of these matters directly affects the resocialization of prisoners and inhibits the successful re-engineering of their social values and beliefs. Objective: to analyze the epidemiological profile of jailed women in the State of Acre, Brazil. Methods: in a cross-sectional descriptive study, 129 participants were recruited from female penitentiaries in the state of Acre. Conducted between August and December of 2017, data was collected through a validated questionnaire, divided into modules, using both open and closed-ended items. Results: we found that most women who participated in the study were single (n = 86, 66.7%), had brown skin (n = 93, 72.1%), had children (n=102, 79.1%), resided in the state of Acre (n=117, 90.5%). The mean age of the sample was 27.69 years. Among those participants who reported having partners (n = 40, 31%), we found that half had partners who were also incarcerated (n = 20, 50%). The study results also indicate that drug trafficking (n = 86, 66.7%) was the major cause for female incarceration, followed by homicide crime (n = 16, 12.4%). Over half of the participants were in prison for the first time (n = 75, 58.1%), with a high recidivism rate observed in the total sample (n = 54, 41.9%). A majority of the participants (n = 97, 75.2%) kept in touch with members of their families and a smaller portion (n = 15, 11.6%) received conjugal visits. With regard to social activities, slightly more than half (n = 75, 58.1%) worked and the majority (n = 114, 88.4%) did not study while jailed. Conclusion: the difficulties associated with accessing inmate data and the lack of peer-reviewed studies on inmate health in Brazil suggests that the public policies recommended by the PNSSP and the National Policy for Comprehensive Health Care for Women should be reevaluated.           ,              Introdução: o sistema prisional no estado brasileiro do Acre, localizado na região ocidental da Amazônia, é um ramo do sistema de justiça criminal que tem sofrido por situações como a superlotação e o crescimento do crime organizado interno. A prevalência destas questões afeta diretamente a ressocialização dos prisioneiros e inibe a preservação bem sucedida dos seus valores e crenças sociais. Objetivo: analisar o perfil epidemiológico das mulheres encarceradas no Estado do Acre, Brasil. Método: Estudo descritivo transversal, sendo que 129 participantes foram recrutadas em penitenciárias femininas no Estado do Acre. Conduzidos entre agosto e dezembro de 2017, os dados foram recolhidos através de um questionário validado, dividido em módulos, utilizando tanto artigos abertos como fechados. Resultados: verificamos que a maioria das mulheres que participaram no estudo eram solteiras (n = 86, 66,7%), tinham pele castanha (n = 93, 72,1%), tinham filhos (n = 102, 79,1%), residiam no estado do Acre (n = 117, 90,5%). A idade média da amostra foi de 27,69 anos. Entre os participantes que declararam ter parceiros (n = 40, 31%), descobrimos que metade tinha parceiros que também estavam encarcerados (n = 20, 50%). Os resultados do estudo indicam também que o tráfico de drogas (n = 86, 66,7%) foi a principal causa de encarceramento feminino, seguido do crime de homicídio (n = 16, 12,4%). Mais de metade dos participantes estiveram na prisão pela primeira vez (n = 75, 58,1%), com uma elevada taxa de reincidência observada na amostra total (n = 54, 41,9%). A maioria dos participantes (n = 97, 75,2%) manteve-se em contato com membros das suas famílias e uma parte menor (n = 15, 11,6%) recebeu visitas conjugais. No que respeita às atividades sociais, pouco mais de metade (n = 75, 58,1%) trabalhou e a maioria (n = 114, 88,4%) não estudou enquanto esteve presa. Conclusão: as dificuldades associadas ao acesso aos dados dos presos e a falta de estudos revistos por pares sobre a saúde dos presos no Brasil sugerem que as políticas públicas recomendadas pelo Plano Nacional de Saúde no Sistema Penitenciário - PNSSP e a Política Nacional de Atenção Integral à Saúde da Mulher - PNAISM devem ser reavaliadas.","2022-01-31","2025-05-04 22:26:17","2025-05-04 22:26:17","2025-05-04 22:26:17","92-100","","1","32","","jhgd","","","","","","","","","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/home/rudi/Zotero/storage/HHHX487T/Djannaro Eliamen Da Costa et al. - 2022 - Outcome Measure Epidemiological of Female Inmates in West Amazon, Brazil.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The article covers three main aspects. First, it explores the existing limits of international criminal law for prosecuting mass deforestation as a crime against humanity, and the contours within which criminalization would be possible. Secondly, it discusses the challenges inherent in the anthropocentric nature of the chapeau requirement of Article 7 for the criminalization of mass deforestation under that provision.

The study was carried out in an environmentally differentiated land-reform project, located in Anapu, Pará: the PDS (Sustainable Development Project) Virola-Jatobá. The material and monetary measurement of environmental components of the wealth within the space studied was carried out using the accounting method. Initially, values were determined, both for environmental assets considered to be in the domain of the state, and for those rights to use and exploit environmental resources granted to settled families. Then, damages and losses resulting from an invasion of the settlement's forest reserve, which took place in 2017, were assessed. The invasion by third parties resulted in deforestation, pasture formation and illegal wood extraction in an area where a community forest management plan was implemented. Establishing a monetary value of damages attests that distributive public policies do not effectively face the social reality in the countryside, in which settlements are impacted and weakened by conflicts, territorial disputes and environmental crimes. The inclusion of new theoretical and practical approaches of environmental accounting in multidisciplinary studies can thus contribute to expand the understanding of social, environmental and economic phenomena inherent to public active inclusion policies.           ,              Este artículo establece procedimientos para la valoración contable de la riqueza que componen los activos ambientales - recursos tierra, bosques y madera - distribuidos por las acciones de reforma agraria en la Amazonía, en el contexto de conflictos y disputas territoriales. El estudio se llevó a cabo como parte de un proyecto de asentamiento ambientalmente diferenciado, ubicado en Anapu, Pará: el Proyecto de Desarrollo Sostenible Virola-Jatobá (PDS). La medición física y monetaria de los componentes ambientales de la riqueza del área estudiada se realizó mediante el método contable. Inicialmente, se determinaron valores, tanto para los activos ambientales considerados de dominio del Estado, como los referidos a los derechos de uso y exploración de los recursos ambientales otorgados a las familias asentadas. Luego, se evaluaron los daños y pérdidas resultantes de la invasión de la reserva forestal del asentamiento, ocurrida en 2017.

Statistical data made available by the Secretariat of Intelligence and Criminal Analysis - SIAC on police reports and procedures put in place to investigate crimes against flora were used, as well as data from the main official platforms for monitoring deforestation in Brazil. The time frame was the period between January 2017 and January 2020. An interview was also conducted with the head of the police station for the repression of crimes against flora. The results showed that crimes against flora in Pará are underreported and that the civil police face serious obstacles to instructing police investigations due to the scarcity of material and human resources in addition to the economic and political power of most of those investigated. The research concludes that for an effective confrontation of crimes against flora, it is necessary to equip the judicial police, educate and raise awareness among the population about their role in informing the authorities about environmental devastation.","2021-01-18","2025-05-04 22:27:10","2025-05-04 22:27:10","2025-05-04 22:27:10","e35310111733","","1","10","","RSD","","","","","","","","","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/home/rudi/Zotero/storage/GXM8ZGQ4/Caldas et al. - 2021 - The role of the civil police of the State of Pará in combating crimes against flora.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While access to justice has been extensively examined through various theoretical lenses within the realm of social sciences, a noticeable void persists in the scientific discourse concerning access to justice for riverside communities within the Amazon region. Consequently, this study delves into the challenges confronted by the Judiciary and other components of the justice system in a Brazilian region characterized by heightened structural intricacies, underscored by the geographic isolation of its populace and a dearth of public services. The primary objective of this research is to elucidate the perspectives of riverside residents in the Amazon region regarding impediments and enablers to accessing justice services. To achieve this goal, there was undertaken a case study within one of the riverside communities in the municipality of Porto de Moz, situated in the state of Pará, Brazil. Employing document analysis and focus groups with local residents, the empirical research sheds light on the prevailing scenario. The findings of the study reveal that the predominant barriers to accessing justice in the surveyed riverside community include geographical isolation, technological constraints – such as unreliable energy infrastructure – and the virtual absence of public authorities in delivering essential services. Conversely, key facilitators of access encompass public-private partnerships, the establishment of digital inclusion points, and itinerant justice initiatives.","2024-06-23","2025-05-04 22:27:14","2025-05-04 22:27:14","2025-05-04 22:27:14","","","2","7","","VE","Access to Justice and Digital Inclusion in the Amazon","","","","","","","","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/home/rudi/Zotero/storage/FXJK2WLN/De Araujo Filho et al. - 2024 - Access to Justice and Digital Inclusion in the Amazon Geographic Vulnerability and Riverside Commun.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

After outlining the legal regime governing slavery-related practices, the author examines why the Brazilian government has failed in its efforts to secure compliance within its own borders of its obligations under anti-slavery and human rights conventions. The author then argues that holding the Brazilian state responsible and assessing monetary damages is not in fact the most effective and fair way to secure the human rights of the victims of forced labour, and that international criminal sanctions for the individual perpetrators – including prosecution in the ICC for crimes against humanity – is a viable and preferable alternative.","2006-03","2025-05-04 22:27:21","2025-05-04 22:27:21","2025-05-04 22:27:21","151-193","","1","19","","Leiden Journal of International Law","Forced Labour in Brazil","","","","","","","en","https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/home/rudi/Zotero/storage/DS4KBJH9/Bischoff - 2006 - Forced Labour in Brazil International Criminal Law as the Ultima Ratio Modality of Human Rig.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this model, ecological conservation becomes a matter of national/natural security, in the form of counterinsurgency to counter illegal economies. Climate change and ecological disaster mean the forest needs the military power of the State to save it from destruction. We argue that such conservation entails a form of necropolitics lying in wait; because to conserve one part is to condemn the other – framed as the enemy – to certain destruction, as land is simultaneously designated for large-scale development projects. Conservation, in effect, becomes tied to a form of extinction. Our article examines two increasingly militarized frontiers that work through conservation in Colombia. The first is where the Andes meets the Amazon rainforest, an area that has seen an increase in deforestation following the 2016 Peace Agreement with the FARC. Deforestation is often attributed to the cultivation of coca (used to produce cocaine), and the solution posited by the government is to eradicate the plant. We argue that eradication of illicit crops is a form of enforced extinction that militarizes the forest, targeting both human and non-human inhabitants. The second frontier concerns coal mining on the Caribbean coast, where mass environmental devastation induced by the industry has led to a forced reorganization of life in the region. The military guards the sites of extraction and those who oppose coal mining become targets for elimination. We bring these two cases – coal and coca – into dialogue, to trace the extinction-driven expansion of extractive economies, a process intertwined with armed conflict, narcotrafficking, and now with transitional politics.","2022-01-24","2025-05-04 22:27:46","2025-05-04 22:27:46","2025-05-04 22:27:46","","","1","28","","","Extinction in transition","","","","","","","","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/home/rudi/Zotero/storage/REJ6HQY9/Martin and Pedraza - 2022 - Extinction in transition coca, coal, and the production of enmity in Colombia's post-peace accords.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
